ArduinoBT Weather Station

 requires Arduino with a bluetooth adapter and a temperature, humidity, and wind (anemometer) sensor. Sketch: bt-weather-arduino.ino

OR

a compatible setup that sends formatted output through the bluetooth adapter serial in the format @10.00;20.00;30.00@

Parts used:

Arduino (any variant)
HC-06 Bluetooth serial adapter
DHT11 - humidity and temperature sensor
Anemometer -- I included the code to allow for a wind sensor that I'll be adding later
